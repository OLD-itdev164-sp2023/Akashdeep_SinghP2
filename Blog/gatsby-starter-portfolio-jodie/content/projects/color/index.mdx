Color (American English), or colour (Commonwealth English), is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color categories, with names such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple.

Color vision is caused by electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum stimulating cone cells in the human eye. Colour categories and physical colour specifications are connected with things based on the wavelength of light reflected from them. The physical qualities of the item, such as light absorption and emission spectra, determine its reflection.

Very colorful.
