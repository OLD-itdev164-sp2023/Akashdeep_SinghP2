When utilised in low-voltage neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes, and neon advertising signs, neon emits a unique reddish-orange glow. The well-known red light of helium-neon lasers is caused by the red emission line from neon. Neon is employed in plasma tubes and refrigerants, although it has few other commercial applications.

It is extracted commercially by fractional distillation of liquid air. Because air is the only supply, it is far more costly than helium.
